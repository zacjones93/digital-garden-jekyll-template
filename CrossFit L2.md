## 6 Attributes of Effective Training

### Teaching
- Knowledge 
	- Things you gain through watching or studying
- Communication 
	- transfer of knowledge
	- How 
	- Layer in points of performance (PoP)
	- Process
		- Tell
		- Show
		- Do
		- Check
	- Do the Process as you keep layering PoP
	- Be simple in how you teach
- Seeing
	- Determine sound from unsound movement
		- need to know what is good and bad
	- Types
		- Static positions
			- Easier to see because there's more time there
			- Scan for faults all around the room
		- Dynamic transitions
			- Movement in between static positions
			- Faster
			- More complex
			- When correcting, watch one person at a time
	- watch more people move
- Correcting
	- Cues
		- Use those that are successful
		- Qualities
			- Short
			- Specific
			- Actionable
			- 95% of the time should be this format
		- Good format
			- body part, and direction
		- Types
			- Verbal
			- Visual
				- Hyper exaggeration is useful here
			- Tactile
	- Triaging
		- Order of operations when correcting movement
			- Safety of the back is the biggest one
			- Find cues that address multiple issues
	- Balance relentlessness and acknowledgement
		- Relentless
			- Stick with the athlete until you know the athlete isn't going to get any better in the moment
		- acknowledgment 
			- Tell them what the did well
			- Where you saw them improve
- Group Management
	- Optimizing client/athlete experience in the gym
		- Plan ahead
			- Lesson planning!
			- You will always be better
		- What goes into every single minute for the class
			- Warm up
			- Points of performance to work on
				- Cues that you're going to use
- Presence & Attitude
	- required to be great at coaching
		- Care
		- Empathy
		- Passion for Service
	- It's all about connecting with an athlete
		- Figure out what they want
		- Type of communication
			- Stern
			- Motivating
			- Encouraging
	- "Be the big YOU"
		- Dial up your personality at 10
		- Steal a little bit from other coaches that you lack
- Demonstartion
	- Movement
		- Demo 
			- Do it well
			- Do it poorly
		- Goal is always to show you're working towards better movement
	- Lifestyle
		- Following the program
		- Nutrition

# Lesson Plan
- Demo
- Set up
	- Start with feet under hips
		- find this by giving a few hops 
		- That's your jumping stance
- Progression
	- Jump and land with hands at sides
		- Foot work
			- Move the feet
			- lets hear those feet in the landing position
	- Jump and land with hands at shoulders
			- Dip and drive
				- Keep torso 
	- Jump and extend the arms after the hips open
		- Full extension
	- Drop jerk
	- Push jerk
- Take away
	- Simplify!
	- What's the reason behind each movement
	- What is most important in the movement

# Common Movement Themes
- The road map to seeing better
- Benefits
	- Performance
	- Safety
- observe
- Faults
- Themes
	- Midline stabilization
		- Transition of force through the body
		- force transfers with a tight core
		- nuetral spine
			- Pelvis stays in line with it
		- faults
			- Flexion of the spine
				- Deadlift
				- Frontsquat
			- hyper extension
				- Overhead
		- small number of acceptable deviations
	- Core to extremity
		- Hand of between high force movers to high velocity movers
			- Fv -> fv - fV
		- from core to limbs
			- "wave of contraction"
		- faults
			- Arms pull early
				- Bar will look further away
	- Balance about the frontal plane
		- Divides athlete in half from the mid foot
		- Most efficient path to apply more power on an object
		- Looking at the athlete and the object
		- Question
			- Mobility issue with people
				- Trade off on having the work on the movement and switching to another lift so they can move load
	- Posterior chain engagemnet
		- Utilize the strong muscles on the back side
			- They are the big muscles and power output
		- leverage backside of the body means more balance
		- Pressure in feet
		- Knees track with toes
		- Hips always extend first
			- Then knees
			- Then ankles
	- Sound hip function
		- Hips have the ability to produce the most force in many movements
		- 'Muted hip'
			- No hip flexion
		- extend hip quickly
	- Active shoulders
		- Natural and neutral position
		- Provide pressure against the load
		- "Yielding to load"
		- Internal rotation
		- Contrived positions
			- 'Pinch your shoulder blades together'
			- Neutral, not over engaged
	- Full range of motion
		- Natural anatomical end ranges
			- Build flexibility and strength in end ranges
		- Strengthening end range of motion is rehabilitative
	- Effective stance
		- Feet under hips
			- Most powerful position
		- Shoulder width
			- More range of motion for hips to drop for squatting
		- 
# Feedback
- focus on how when focusing on pop
- Look for one thing
	- Don't respond to what is happening
- 22 filler word
	- Be intentional with filler words
- check backs after correction
- Don't have to move perfectly in the progression

# Nutrition
- Behavior change
- Dr. Albert Bandera
- Self efficacy
	- The belief in oneself that you can make the change
	- Ways to gain self efficacy
		- Mastery experiences
			- Small wins on a day to day basis
			- Fast iterations towards the goal
		- Vicarious experiences
			- Testimonials
			- Be around people that show you it's possible
		- Emotional and physiological satates
			- States of mindset
				- Anxiety
				- Depression
			- having empathy for those stages/mindsets
		- verbal And social persuasion
			- supporting clients through this process
			- Educational pieces
	- goal is to balance the aspects of self efficacy as going through stages
	- stages
		- Contemptlation
			- Recognize problem
			- Desire to make the change
			- Take away
				- Educate!
					- Small talks
						- Types of foods
							- Examples
							- What are you eating?
						- Meal prep
							- Maybe the don't eat
							- Quality is best early on
					- larger lectures
						- Make a food log
			-  perception is reality
			- They know they have a problem but not a high definition solution
		- Action
			- Change is happening
			- Connect them with people who walk the walk
				- Testimonials
				- Before/after success stories
			- Lead by example
				- People are watching
			- Direct vs. progressive approach
			- Accountability and feedback are critical'
		- Maintenance
			- Healthy skills aquired
			- long-term sustainability
			- Continue to educate
				- Emotional and esteem support
				- Informational
			- show them the data
				- Progress through numbers



# Programming
- It's all about Fitness
- What builds fitness
	- Variance
	- Intensity
- secondary to
	- Effective programming
	- Consistency 
	- Intensity that workouts are done at
	- Effective scaling
- Analyze the effectiveness
	- Measure
		- Benchmarks
		- Have to look at a lot of different time and modal domains
		- Improved performance markers
		- Improved health markers
		- Developing skills
	- Log books
		- Software
		- Whiteboard
	- target weakspots
		- if you spot a weakness, add movements that build capacity in that area
- Create Variance
	- (F*d) / t = Power === Itensity
		- drives results
	- Vary
		- loads
		- duration
			- 15 minutes or less
		- Reps
			- Task priority
				- More intensity
		- Movements
			- Couplets
			- Triplets
			- Singles
			- full body / high power movements
			- Complimentary movement functions
- Scale Effectively
	- Preserve the stimulus of the workout
	- Match the relative intensity of the athlete
	- Populations to scale for
		- Beginners
			- New to crossfit
			- Scale intensity
			- Minimize load
			- Minimize number of reps and time domains
			- Scale the range of motion or movement mechanics
		- Intermediate
			- 6 months - 3 years
			- Maybe they Rx some things
			- Provide scales that actually challenge them
				- Scale the volume
				- Change up the scale to build the different skills of a movement
		- Advanced
			- 3+ years of CrossFit
			- also need scaling
			- Scale them down and make them work on mechanics
			- "Do reps unbroken"
		- Injured
			- Keep them coming in from the gym
			- Work on one side
- Address Weaknesses
	- Build in skills
		- Warm ups
		- Cool downs
			- Skill development
				- Rope climb work at the end
				- Getting under the bar
	- Keep id'ing new weaknesses
	- Shouldn't steal from the focus of the workout
