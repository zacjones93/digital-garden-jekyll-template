- Got some really useful feedback from [[Maggie Appleton]] on [[Course banners and CTAs]] and [[design]] in general
- Gradients work best with light at the top to mimic the way we see light in the world. (e.g. sun shining down, lamps)
- You always want 60-100px spacing from edges to logo or text. 
- Keep spacing consistent around the whole design
