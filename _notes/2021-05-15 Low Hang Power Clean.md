tags: CrossFit

Evaluator: [[Tucker Jones]]

Movement: low [[Hang Power Clean]]

## Areas of Excellence
- very good demo's
- good progression (can tell you prepared)
- lot's of movement w/ barbell
- moved well through members
- good temperament

Good mixture of verbal and visual cues

## Areas for Improvement

- a little nervous / uncertain
- "shoulders over knees" -> shoulders should be in front of bar
- tell athletes to use hook grip
- call dip -> "High hang position"
- didn't do static low hang power clean
- no cues on set of 5

**use physical cues**

## Athlete Faults
- Toes turned out in start position
- no hook grip
- high pull elbows back vs. scarecrow
- head angle down
- bar looping a little bit

## Self Reflection

- As I was working the athletes through the progressions, I could tell that I wasn't catching faults that I should be. I had a whole set where I didn't cue any of the athletes.
  - Before hand, think through common faults I know people will struggle with and prep the cues for them

- Confidence in the presentation -- not much I can do here other than keep doing it and know that I'm prepared and know what I'm talking about.

- My movement through athletes was better than the first time
  - didn't walk through the athletes
  - kept at 45º angles to see everyone at once

- Feel good about my progressions that I take people through.

- If an athlete over corrects, mention that and give another cue
  - e.g. feet too narrow then too wide on power clean
