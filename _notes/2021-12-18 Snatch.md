Evaluator: [[Tucker Jones]] & [[coach/Kevin Pei]]

Movement: Push Press

## Take aways
- watch the clock a little closer
  - if you have the time, add to the progression
- more confident language
  - quit the 'uh's and 'kinda's
  
- KEEP IT SIMPLE
  - no one needs a high-level break down with their cue

## Areas of Excellence
- good progression
- good mov't around athletes
- best projection I've heard from you
- good job getting all types of cues

- louder
- walked around a lot
- good use of names
- a lot of great cues
- control of class
## Areas for Improvement

- Pronounce "burgener" correctly
- just show a normal stance
- could have added high hang squat snatch, low hang, full snatch
- at one point, visual cue with bard didn't use hook grip=
- "kinda"

- A lot of verbal, technical explanation
- say 'low hang' in 3 position drill instead of 'knees'
- look for hook grip
- always show hook grip first
- simplify directions -> "hang, low hang"
  - just say low hang
- "kind of"
- simplify cues
