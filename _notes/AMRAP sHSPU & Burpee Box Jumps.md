```
AMRAP 10
6 Strict Handstand Push Ups (Fx: kipping) (Rx+: 9)
12 Burpee Box Jumps (24/20)
```

## Intro
- The workout we have today is an AMRAP for 10 minutes
- You'll be doing 6 strict HSPU as Rx and 12 Burpee Box Jumps
- This workout will come down to your muscle endurance for HSPU
- The burpees box jumps are there to get your heart rate going for your next set of HSPU

## Standards
- Rx
  - For Rx, you need to be doing 6 strict hspu with no kipping involved
  - The burpee box jump is facing the box and you don't jump over, just to the top and back down
  - The height of the box is the same for Rx and Fx
- Fx
  - If you're Fx'ing it today, you'll do the same number of HSPU but adding the kip into the movement
  - The burpee box jump is the same height
- Rx+
  - 9 sHSPU instead of 6

## Strategy
- The idea for this workout is to do the largest sets of HSPU that you can maintain for 10 minutes
- If you find yourself doing more than 3 sets in a round, you should scale down
- For the burpees, you should go at a moderate pace but definitely don't burn yourself out -- this is all about the HSPU

## Scaling
- There are a good number of options for scaling the HSPU
- kipping is the first scale
- if you want to stay strict you can add an abmat and do less range of motion
- we can show you what a pike hspu from a box looks like
- and if none of that is working for you, seated dumbbell press at a weight that works for you is a good option

## Movement Breakdown

### sHSPU
**standard**
- have arms at full extension at the top
- touch your head to the ground and extend until you reach the top again with arms locked out
- your arms should be in a tripod
  - avoid putting your hands in line with your head, it's a weak position
  - (much like a strict press with a barbell)
- but stays off the wall

**Points of Performance**
- big breath at the top and hold
  - keep belly tight
  - ribs down and inline
- hands just outside shoulders
- arms extended
- elbows move forward as you descend
- open shoulders all the way at the top

### Burpee Box Jump
**Standard**
- face the box
- chest touches the floor at the bottom
- jump with two feet to the top of the box
- extend hips fully
