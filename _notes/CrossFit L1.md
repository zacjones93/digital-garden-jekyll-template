[[CrossFit]] L1

## Intro
Alex Gowers - CrossFit Reston/fairfax
Kristin Bowen - CrossFit takeover

## CrossFit Definition

Constant movement that’s infinitely scalable

Definition:
**constantly varied, function movement executed at high intensity**

### Function movement
Over used word - everything is functional

6 characteristics

- Natural

To human movement 
No one has taught you how to do these movements. Not gym movements, you do them anyway

- universal motor recruitment patterns

They are found everywhere. We are wired to do them.
- essential

To independent living and quality of life
…squat out of feet, deadlift something off the floor.
Loss of functional capacity is what puts people in nursing home
**Acts as a hedge to decrepitude**

- Compound yet irreducible

Multi-joint
Cannot train these movements in isolation. Can’t expect to get the same results if we do
Function movements elicit a systemic response
- safe

They are natural. We are BUILT to do them.
Done *correctly, there’s an even distribution of force
Hierarchy of safety. A post-max load on a back squat is still safe while a post-max load on a chest fly will hurt you
Least safe — not training these movements at all
More safe — training functional movements (even with bad form) because it will get better
Most safe — performing functional movements with good form
- Core to extremity movement patterns

Punch, throw, kick, swing all start at the core and radiate out to extremities


High force producing, low velocity
  Core, hips, erectors 
->
medium force, medium velocity
	legs
->
low force, high velocity 
 	arms, hands, wrists

None are more important than the others

### High intensity

**Move large loads, long distance, quickly**

Move large loads - Force
long distance - distance
quickly - time

(F * d) / t  = power

This is objective, not subjective.

It’s measurable, we can put a number to our output 

Intensity = average power 
A lot of use of this word is correlates of intensity

Heart rate does not equal intensity

The independent variable most commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return on favorable adaptations

OR it’s where its at

It gets us results

**Intensity is relative**
relative to physical and psychological tolerances
What can the body handle
What can the mind handle

If you keep people pushing their relative intensity, they will see results.

Needs of Olympic athletes differ by degree, not kind from ‘regular’ people.
Whether that’s a PR at 315 or 65 lbs.. it matters that its the right intensity for that person

### Constantly varied

**Broad, general, and inclusive**

**We fail at the margins of our experience.**

If you’re on a regular gym lifting routine, you experience won’t be very broad

We want to blur the lines of experience with real life

Environmental factors don’t need to be tweaked as much as force, distance, and time.

It’s a compromise of skills

A GPP program

## What is Fitness?

Adaptive capacity to span any specialty you choose

The overlap of different sports is fitness

Different models of fitness

### [[Ten general physical skills]]

Balance of physiological adaptations

Organic skills - mostly training
- cardio respiratory endurance
- Strength 
	- Productive application of force
		- Productively overlaying coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy
- Stamina
- Flexibility

Combination from both organic and neurological
- Power
- Speed

developed through practice — neurological skills
Technique and task accomplishment
DU
- Coordination
- Agility
- Balance
- Accuracy

develop these skills with a combination of training and practice

### the hopper
Perform statistically best across different athletes 

Balance of skills and drills

### metabolic pathways 

ATP is what your body needs

- Phosphogen  pathway 100%
Anaerobic
- glycolytic 70%
Anaerobic
- Oxidative pathway 40%
Aerobic

Balance of bioenergetics

### sickness / wellness / fitness continuum 

Balance of lifestyle

Sick -> Well -> Fit

Fitness is a state of super health

You want to push yourself to as far to fit as possible

This all comes from measured observation — empirical.


**Work capacity across broad time and modal domains** — throughout life (health)

### Technique

Functional movements have a neurological component.
This comes down to technique

What qualifies as optimal technique?
**The movements/positions used to accomplish a task**

Optimal task accomplishment.

Coordination and accuracy can result in greater fitness because you are more efficient with the strength and stamina you have

### Technique vs intensity
- adding weight
- Volume
- Faster

There’s a universal tension of precision and speed are required for success.

This is balanced with **threshold training** - as you succeed in one of the areas, you push the other

Mistakes are an inevitable for progression.

Consistent correction of mistakes at higher and higher speeds is when we become great at something

This develops **virtuosity**
Doing the common uncommonly well

#### Coaching environment

3 different athlete category
- pukie
	- All over the place with their lifts
	- Have huge intensity but not control
- Kevin
	- Look at coach after every rep
- Goldie
	- Good for a few reps then technique breaks down

There is just enough intensity that your technique breaks down a little bit so you get better. 

What are the points of performance of the movement?
Is the athlete hitting all the PoP?
Are they responding to cues?
What’s the capacity?

**3 key aspects of adjusting intensity**
- Safety — risk
- Efficacy — results
- Efficiency — seeing results in timely manner

Too much emphasis on one will diminish or erase the others

Charter —
Step 1: Mechanics
	can my athlete get into the proper positions. Can they do it consistently
Step 2: Consistency
Step 3: Intensity
Doesn’t matter how long it takes to get to intensity - just that it happens eventually and progress is made

It’s **technique and intensity**

### [[CrossFit Nutrition]]

## Programming
Do 6 months of CrossFit.com programming to expose yourself to the longest source of programming out there

Workout elements and variance

### Movements 
1. Modality
Gymnastics - 
body weight, own body through time and space
Weightlifting
Controlling the body in addition to an external object
Monostructural metabolic conditioning
Classic cardio.
2. Number of movements
1, 2, 3, 4+
Most intensity lies in couplets or triplets
3. Function
Push / pull
Upper body / lower body
Pressing vertical / pressing horizontally 
4. Load
Body weight -> 1RM
5. Rep / distance
1-1000+

### Time

3 priority
- task priority - volume is set. You know the exact work that is to be completed
As time goes down power goes up

- time priority - duration is set. You don’t know how much work you’ll do
As reps go up, power goes up
More incentive to pace on time priority workouts.

- heavy day
As you add load, power goes up

### Combining elements effectively
Themes that are more often programmed
1.  Couplets and triplets
2. Full body workouts
3. Task priority workouts
4. Shorter in over all duration (<= 15 min)
5. Complimentary movement pairings
Muscles you use to squat and press are different than pulling (Fran)

You only get better at the things that you do.

Some workouts that have movement interference and localized muscle fatigue are beneficial (JT) to throw in for variance.

### Session Elements — 5x5 squat example
(Minutes)
Warm Up (3) 
Go over logistics
- general (5)
Elevate heart rate, raise core temperature, dynamic stretching
- Specific (15)
Show them how to squat, go over PoP
Show how to actually squat with a barbell
Athletes need to warm up to working sets 
(3) minute break
Workout (27)
Feel like you need to have rest after 
80% + generally
Cool down (7)
Regaining homeostasis
Stretching and recording scores

Shorter workouts mean more time warming up / adding skill work / adding low intensity accessory

### Scaling
Endeavor to preserve as much of the original stimulus as possible

1. Scale intensity
- scaling load
- scaling volume
2. Substation of movement
- swap function that’s close as possible
	goal is to preserve range of motion of original movement
- Remove a function
3. Change function

Goal: drive forward progress, get better
Not just be easy

### Rest
Choose rest before rest chooses you
- Full
- Active Recovery
Walk/ hike is active recovery, not full rest.m

Actively program rest

## [[Movements]]

### Common themes or [[PoP]]
- midline stability
- Posterior chain engagement
- Core to etremity movement patterns
- Full range of motion
- Active shoulders

The movements bellow are the 9 foundational movements. Knowing these 9 and you are a couple steps away from any other functional movement

- [[Press Movements]]
