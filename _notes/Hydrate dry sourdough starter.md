## Terminology
- starter (culture)
    - The mix of of flour, water, and bacteria that creates delicious bread
- Active starter (levain)
    - A starter that is at peak activity.
    - Typically has risen 2-3x it’s starting volume
    - A healthy starter will become active in 4-8 hours depending on room temperature
- Dry starter
    - What you have in a jar to start
    - Dry starter is active starter that is spread thing and dried out. This preserves the bacteria to be reactivated with more water and flour
- Regular feeding
    - Mix 5g starter, 20g water, and 20g flour until fully incorporated 

## Day 1
  - Put dry sourdough starter in jar
  - Measure 40g water
  - Mix until starter is thoroughly incorporated 
      - This can take 3-5 minutes
  - Measure out 40g all purpose flour
  - Stir until mix resembles thick pancake batter
      - Any dry pockets will remain dry if not mixed properly
  - Let rest for ~24 hours
  
## Day 2
  - some bubbles should be seen
  - Might have risen a little
  - Perform regular feeding 
      - Measure out 5g starter
          - This doesn’t seem like much but I like to keep just a small amount so I don’t waste so much flour maintaining the starter
          - Discard the remainder of starter (it’s not ready to keep as discard yet)
      - Measure out 20g water
      - Mix water and starter fully
      - Measure out 20g all purpose flour
      - Stir flour until the mix resembles thick pancake batter
  - Rest for ~12 hours
  - Repeat steps from the start of the day

## Day 3
  - it’s possible the starter has doubled in size and become fully active at this point
  - If not, repeat day 2
  - If active, it’s ready to be fed to bake a loaf of bread
      - If you  are not not ready to bake you can store in the fridge for up to a month
      - Do a regular feeding and put in fridge after 2-3 hours so the starter is active but still has food while stored

## Prepare starter for baking bread
  - Measure out 20g starter into jar
  - Mix 60g water and stir
  - Mix in 60g flour and stir until mix looks like thick pancake batter
  - Put a rubber band around the jar that marks the starting height of starter within jar
  - Rest for ~8 hour
      - I typically feed my starter before going to bed and start the bread in the morning
  - Starter should have doubled or tripled in size
