10 Steps is an [[instructional design]] framework focused on complex learning that integrates knowledge and skills (of all types). The goal of this learning is to apply it to the real world where it is useful to the learner.

One of the biggest ideas threaded throughout the framework is the prevention of [[Fragmentation]] and [[Compartmentalization]]. This is the act of breaking concepts down so much that they lose their relevance in the context that they are actually used in. In other words, removing the context of applying a skill or concept inherently changes the way that skill or concept is learned and percieved.

The primary method for combatting [[Fragmentation]] and [[Compartmentalization]] is through the development of Real-life [[learning task]]s as the core unit of instructional design. 

Everything else flows from the development of learning tasks.

Below I put together summaries of the chapters I've worked through:

- [[A New Approach to Instruction]] - an overview of the framework
- [[Four Blueprint Components]] - the pillars of 10 steps
