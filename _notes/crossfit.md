Fitness is measured and defined as the work capacity of an individual across time and modal domains while [[health]] is defined as fitness spanning your life time.

## Coaching

I have recently started my coaching journey after 8 years of being an athlete with CrossFit. Below you will find my notes on different aspects of coaching.

A foundational piece to coaching within CrossFit (and in general!) is the progressions that you take people through to warm up as well as build the skill and body awareness necessary to perform movements with excellence.

I will be posting the progressions and metcon breakdowns that I make here:

### Coaches Practice Evaluations

These are evaluation sessions that [[CrossFit Route 7]] hosts for it's coaches to work on the various skills to be an effective coach. In particular -- class management skills and identifying/cueing faults that athletes perform while performing the various functional movements that can be found in workouts.
