A [[Ten Steps]] instructional design concept.


At [[egghead]], we've been talking alot about how real life projects and apps are ill-structured and multidisciplinary. This is what a learning task is.

Ill-structured means there are trade-offs, unknown aspects, and multiple acceptable solutions that you need to weigh. You don't just get a cookie cutter problem that fits has a clear solution.

Multidisciplinary means there are different dicisplines and teams involved in the problem space. Rarely is a developer given a project without business requirements, design, constraints on the data, etc.

The catch is... this is hard to plan.
