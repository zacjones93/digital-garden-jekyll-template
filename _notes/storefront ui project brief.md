title: storefront ui project brief
tags: dev
---

This is a initial [[learning task]] that I've iterated on. The previous iteration of this project brief was tied closely to a framework (Vue 3) and course that egghead published with [[Kevin Cunningham]].

The idea behind this iteration is to provide the multidisciplinary inputs needed for a real life [[learning task]]. 

With building out a storefront ui, you need data, app requirements, and design to work off of. The projects gives you those and leaves it to you to choose your technology to implement.

This project spins up an express server that is backed by a SQLite + Prisma database that is seeded with several products for you.
