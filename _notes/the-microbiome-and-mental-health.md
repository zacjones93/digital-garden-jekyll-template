# Key Takeaways

# [[Gut Biology Key Terms]]

- [[Enteric nervous system]]
- [[Major depressive disorder]]
- HPA axis
- [[Neurotransmitters]]
- [[Tryptophan]]
- [[Serotonin]]
- [[Cytokine]]
- [[Leaky gut]]
- Corticotropin releasing hormone
- ACTH
- Cortisol
- [[Vagus nerve]]

# Gut is your Second Brain

-   Called the [[enteric nervous system]]
-   Two thin layers of more than 100 million nerves
-   More neurons than a cat’s true brain
-   Controls digestion from swallowing, to the release of enzymes, to blood flow, to elimination of waste
-   For years doctor’s assumed anxiety and depression contributed to diarrhea, bloating, upset stomach, etc but we now know that this is a bi-directional pathway involving the microbiome
    
    Not just your thoughts and emotions impacting your gut, but your gut impacting your thoughts and emotions


<a id="orgd477672"></a>

# Why so important?

-   The lifetime prevalence of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) is more than 10%
-   Lifetime anxiety disorders is approaching 30+%
-   The World Health Organization predicted that by 2020 only heart disease will outrank depression for global disease burden


<a id="org32a2433"></a>

# Gut Brain Immune Connection

-   During infection, immune cells release [[cytokines]] that cause loss of appetite, low mood, loss of motivation, fatigue and social withdrawal
-   Many of those descriptions fit the description of depression as well
-   Depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia have consistently been shown to correlate with increased (though low grade) inflammatory markers
-   Depression can be triggered by administration of exogenous [[cytokines]]


<a id="org9947ccc"></a>

## 1) Inflammation

-   “[[Leaky gut]]” or the microbial translocation of bacterial products across the gastrointestinal epithelium is one major theory
    -   Depression, autism and Alzheimer’s disease all report increase elevated levels of a key inflammatory bacterial product called [[LPS]]
-   Chronic stress is also known to increase intestinal permeability through the production of [[cortisol]] and catecholamines
-   Notably, rat models of depression are reversed by the administration of B. infantis through reductions in inflammation
-   The same probiotic normalizes inflammation in patients with IBS as well

-   Germ free mice have significant reductions in a brain specific immune cell called microglia
    microglia are like [[macrophages]] in the brain
-   A full, diverse spread of bacteria are needed for the maturation of these cells
-   The mechanism appears to be the critical production of [[short chain fatty acids]] such as [[butyrate]], acetate and propionate

# 2) The [[HPA axis]] &#x2013; hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal gland

-   The HPA axis is best known for regulating the stress response
    -   Stress causes the production of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)
    -   CRH drives the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone ([[ACTH]]) by the pituitary
    -   ACTH drives the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands
-   Evidence for a connection to the gut
    -   Germ free mice express higher levels of ACTH and cortisol release in a stress test
        -   Completely reversed by the presence of a single bacteria, Bifidobacterium infantis
        -   This reversal was time dependent, if you wait too long, the effect is permanent
        -   Further research implicates microbial modulation of [[serotonin]], glutamate, and other key neurotransmitters
            
            This stress response is set for life after an early age

# 3) Short chain fatty acids [Short Chain Fatty Acids]

-   The digestion of various forms of fiber by the microbiome generate metabolites that are used for multiple functions
-   The byproduct of resistant start are the short chain fatty acids [[butyrate]], acetate and propionate
-   Locally, the SCFA influence the neuroendocrine system through inducing the release of PYY (satiety hormone) and [[serotonin]]
    
    Most serotonin in your body is in your gut, not your brain

-   However, the SCFA can also travel through the rest of the body influencing a significant number of other processes


<a id="orgb50f6c0"></a>

## Butyrate has shown preclinical (mice) beneficial effects for:

-   Depression
-   Autism
-   Huntington’s disease
-   Parkinson’s
-   Alzheimer’s


<a id="orgb42c02e"></a>

# 4) Microbial production of [[neurotransmitters]]

-   The gut bacteria have the ability to produce multiple neurotransmitters
    • GABA
    • Noradrenaline
    • Serotonin
    • Dopamine
    • Acetylcholine
    Not proven to effect the nervous system but highly correlated

-   Of course, the quantities are much smaller and the impact on the overall function of the brain remains unclear


<a id="org6687544"></a>

# [[Vagus Nerve]]

-   The major parasympathetic nerve in the body
-   Plays a key part in regulating heart rate, bronchial constriction, and gut motility, etc.
-   Stimulation of this parasympathetic pathway has an anti-inflammatory effect
-   The vagus nerve is an appears to respond to, and relay information about, changes in gut bacteria
    -   Responds to bacterial signals through bacterial metabolites and through interaction with gut enteroendocrine cells
-   Probiotic benefits on anxiety (previously mentioned) are dependent upon the vagus nerve
    -   Severing the nerve eliminates the benefit of Lactobacillus rhamnonsus on anxiety


<a id="org5096782"></a>

# 5) [[Tryptophan]] and [[Serotonin]] biology

-   90% of the serotonin in the body exists in the gut
-   The pathway involves the conversion of

tryptophan -> 5-HT -> serotonin
Germ free mice have way less 5-HT than regular

-   Germ free mice have significantly LESS 5-HT than normal mice
    -   Bacteria induce expression of key enzymes for production
-   In the brain, tryptophan is converted via the Kynurenine pathway
    -   Immune activation through, something like [[leaky gut]] induces heightened expression of molecules that suppress this pathway
    -   The microbiome also impacts this pathway through modulating

tryptophan levels

# Summary

-   The microbiome is a key component of the gut–brain axis
-   Communication with the brain occurs via the HPA axis, the immune system, serotonin/tryptophan metabolism, and the production of various neurotransmitters
    -   The Vagus nerve appears critical for this process
-   Patients with a wide variety of neurological diseases have distinct microbiomes
-   Certain probiotics have demonstrated the ability to improve anxiety and cognition
